        <h2>Hiking tips</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>You should always carry a map with you.</li>
            <li>Head lamp</li>
            <li>First aid kit</li>
            <li>Knife</li>
            <li>Fire starter</li>
            <li>Axe</li>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Clothing and sun protection</li>
        </ul>

        With all of these equipped, you will be better prepared for the outdoors. When it comes to dangerous situations,
        you
        will have the tools in which you need to prepare yourself for any situation.


        <h2>Best Practices For Hiking</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the weather conditions.</li>
            <li>Tell somebody your plans.</li>
            <li>Carry a tent.</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated and keep in mind the concept of leaving no trace behind.</li>
        </ul>

        Water is especially important when you go on hikes, so you don't get dehydrated while you're out in the
        wilderness.
        It's important that you keep this in mind so you can have a great time while you hike.
        <br>
        You should also pack food so that if you get hungry you have something to snack on. When it comes to leaving no
        trace behind, after you have your snack, you shouldn't leave wrappers and garbage around. At the end of the day
        the
        trail is a public place where people and animals are going to come and go, and animals can choke on the plastic
        or
        the trash that you leave behind.

        <h2>Preparing For The Unknown</h2>
        How to prepare for the unknown circumstances that may be out there when you are hiking:
        <ul>
            <li>You should always bring a first aid kit.</li>
            <li>A phone or device that has satellite communication, just in case you get into an area with not good
                coverage
                or no coverage.</li>
            <li>You should carry bear sprays in case there are bears that are trying to attack you.</li>
            <li>You should remember to treat the animals and the other people hiking there with kindness so that you all
                walk away enjoying yourself after the hike.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
        Some things that you should watch out for before you start your hiking adventure:
        <ul>
            <li>You should make sure that it's not raining or muddy when you are hiking, because you could slip or fall.
            </li>
            <li>You should keep in mind the time of day that you're hiking to avoid hiking at night due to lack of
                sight.
            </li>
            <li>You should hike with a buddy if you don't know the trail that you're hiking, just so you can be extra
                safe.
            </li>
            <li>You should not hike in the woods at dark.</li>
            <li>You should not start playing Fortnite on your computer in the middle of the night, in the middle of the
                woods on a hiking trail. This could lead to the animals being annoyed because they do not know what
                Fortnite
                is. They may be upset because they want to just sleep and you are making loud noises, and they do not
                like
                that.</li>
            <li>You should be respectful of the area in which you are at, because there are other creatures that call
                that
                their home.</li>
        </ul>
